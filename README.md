# Hi I'm Mark
TL;DR: I'm a creative free spirit with years of IT experience. I enjoy using my design and technical skills to help teams, individuals and companies make delightful products for their customers. I created this document to help new team members get to know me and my working style.

I grew up as a privileged beach grom in beautiful Santa Barbara California. I say this with humility because since leaving California in my twenties I not only realized the harsh realities of life outside my bubble but also the amazing things I was missing from life. I have lived in Louisiana, San Francisco, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and North Carolina and in each place have found a creative tribe to connect with.

My interest in school was theatre arts and from an early age sought out mentors which I believe is the way I learn best. After high school I apprenticed with a sculptor who taught me about form and how to listen to what a material wanted to express. I worked with an oil artist who taught be about process, composition, color, and line. In college I continued learning stagecraft and theatre production where I learned what it takes to plan, create, and run a show which in-turn prepared me to work in creative fields like marketing and web development.

In grade school I remember going to the library to play Lunar Lander on the Commodore PET; of course I don't remember the spelling and math games but I'm sure they were there too. When the World Wide Web came along 12 years later I had already been connecting my Commodore 64 to BBS, FidoNet, and Usenet to share binary files, and email friends. I don't consider myself a programer but I like to read and understand code though probably just enough to initiate SkyNet. I have lived through the evolution of networks, languages, content, and devices and I’m excited that the next branch of the evolution is only a few development cycles away. 

## My Role as Scrum Master

Imagine your on a Scrum Team that is struggling to make its sprint goals and is frustrated with outside leadership, personal performance, and career growth. Now imagine I join your team and help you find new ways to engage with each other and leadership, create space for you to develop, remove annoying impediments, give you the authority to do what you do best, and finally help the team put their goals into perspective. Hopefully you’ll feel less frustrated knowing I’m here to help and that I’ve got your back.

Don't 'do' agile, be agile. Forget everything else and focus on making working software. Let me and the Product Owner worry about the crap that's hindering you from this goal. I will nudge you to focus as often as needed and I expect you to nudge me as well.

I will always default to the Scrum Framework/Values **but** I'm open to variants and experimenting with different paths to the end result. I will bring questions directly to the team about whether the new method is working and will facilitate the adoption and optimization. 

As a coach I will use my experience and curiousity to bring out the best in you. I may not have an answer to your question but I will listen to you and respect your candor and privacy. I am always learning and my next lesson may come from you.


## My Core Values

**Work Non-work Balance:** At the end of the day I leave it all at the office. When we allow ourselves the space to open our minds and free our soul we're better problem solvers and more open to adversity. That said I will respond to a txt or email that leads with URGENT or 911.

**Inclusive > Exclusive:** You can't say 'you can't play.' Bringing people together enriches the environment for problem solving by giving everyone a voice.

**You Can Be Both Kind and Fierce:** Passion and argument are both acceptable and encouraged but should only be limited to the subject at hand and should never get personal.

**Team Comes First:** I am committed to helping us become a higher performing team. I expect high performance and will perform my best to remove any impediments that will interfere with us meeting our commitments.

**Always Question Assumptions:** Count on me to ask why we're doing what we're doing because if nobody asks why you end up with something like 'Microsoft Zune.'

**Always Be on the Edge of Chaos:** If we are feeling comfortable, there is something wrong. I will push boundaries when I feel like it will help the team improve and I expect you to bring fun/strange new ideas up to the team for consideration.

**Stepping Back for Perspective:** When we are stuck, get away from our desks, get out of the building, take a larger perspective and compare that to what we're stuck on. By giving a problem context we may uncover a better/alternate solution. 


## Living Document

This is a living document that I intend to append and edit when I learn something new about myself or find new methods to collaborate. You are invited to create a pull request or an issue if there is something you want to change or update though you should probably just chat or email me first, thanks.
